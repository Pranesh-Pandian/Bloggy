                <h1>AUTHOR</h1>
                <p><b>Takeshi Shudo</b> born August 18, 1949 was a Japanese scriptwriter and novelist. His major works include anime <b>Space Warrior Baldios, the Magical Princess Minky Momo series, and Pokémon</b>, of which he created the Pokémon <b>Lugia</b>. He had a reputation for his witty dialogue and was known for the <b>unusual next episode previews</b> in the series he served as chief writer for. In Pokémon, he coined Team Rocket's iconic motto. He was also a member of the <b>Writers Guild of Japan.</b></p>
                <p>Shudo was born in <b>Fukuoka Prefecture</b>, but moved to <b>Tokyo, Sapporo, and Nara Prefecture</b> when he was a child because his father was a government official, and he attributes his dry, non-indigenous style to this experience. When he failed the college entrance exams, he read a specialized magazine that his younger sister had bought, <b>Scenario</b>, which led him to enroll in a screenplay institute with the funds he had saved up to go to prep school.</p>
                <p>On October 28, 2010, he collapsed after suffering a <b>subarachnoid hemorrhage</b> in a smoking room at <b>JR-West Nara Station</b> in <b>Nara, Nara Prefecture</b>, where he was visiting, and was rushed to the hospital. However, he died on the next day at the age of <b>61</b>. In 2011, a memorial exhibition titled <b>"In Memoriam of the Screenwriter Takeshi Shudo"</b> was held at the <b>Suginami Animation Museum</b> in <b>Suginami, Tokyo.</b><span id="chrh"></span></p>

                <h1>CHARACTERS</h1>
                <h2>Ash Ketchum</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Pokemon/ash.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Ash Ketchum</b> is the main <b>protagonist</b> of the <b>Pokémon Anime</b> Series, serving as one of the two main protagonists (alongside his Pikachu) of the first <b>25 seasons</b> of the series. <b>Pikachu</b> is the only Pokémon he travels with to every region he goes to in his journey. Ash's ultimate goal is to become a <b>Pokémon Master</b>, the greatest Pokémon Trainer ever.</p>
                <p>One particular characteristic about Ash that has not changed throughout the series, aside from his determination and his passion for raising and training Pokémon, is that he is incredibly selfless. He will often go to extraordinary lengths to earn a Pokémon's trust and respect and to better understand a Pokémon that he sees as troubled. He is also very fair-minded and trusting, a true testament to his good-natured character.</p>
                <p>When a Pokemon was abandoned by their previous trainers who are selfish and power-hungry jerks that deemed them to be weak, Ash is generous enough to invite the released Pokemon to join him to prove their former trainers they're wrong.</p>
                <h2>Ash's Pikachu</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Pokemon/pikachu.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Pikachu</b> is the iconic <b>deuteragonist/central protagonist</b> of the <b>Pokemon anime</b>, serving as one of the two main protagonists (alongside Ash Ketchum) of Pokémon the Series from 1997-2022 and is also the titular protagonist of the <b>Pikachu Shorts series</b>. Pikachu is Ash's first Pokémon and signature traveling partner.</p>
                <p>Pikachu is very ambitious, because he hates being defeated. At the beginning of the series, he was easily aggravated and hesitant to warm up to Ash. He is also sensitive because he understood <b>Piplup’s</b> dealings and cried.</p>
                <p>This Pikachu Ash owned is confirmed to be a male due to the gender different that female a Pikachu had <b>heart-shaped tail.</b> Pikachu is the first Pokémon to defeat a mega evolved Pokémon in the anime without mega evolving</p>
                <p>Pikachu always destroyed Ash's female companions' bicycles by his thunderbolt. Bro is a <b>Sigma Pokemon</b> with this.</p>
                <h2>Serena</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Pokemon/serena.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Serena</b> is the <b>deuteragonist</b> of <b>Pokémon the Series: XY and XYZ</b>. She is an aspiring Pokémon Performer and a former traveling companion to her childhood friend and crush, <b>Ash Ketchum.</b></p>
                <p> Serena was very sassy and rebellious towards her own mother and formerly disliked <b>Rhyhorn racing</b>. However, she later proves herself to be very kind and polite, being able to get along with others pretty well and has shown concern for others. Serena loves fashion and is particular about her appearance. Serena is skilled in baking, making <b>cookies or Poké Puffs</b> for both her friends and the other Pokémon. She hates to get dirty, albeit wet or muddy.</p>
                <p>One thing that shines about Serena's character is her deep affection towards <b>Ash</b>, ever since he helped her and guided her back to the campsite, even as the years passed since then, she still recognizes him by watching him on tv and embarked on a journey to find him. Serena admires his sense of determination and takes his advice to heart and often encourages him in his battles, she also blushes when looking at or talking to him. At the end of their journey before leaving for Hoenn, Serena ultimately musters up the courage to <b>kiss</b> Ash Ketchum while promising to become a more remarkable lady for him when they meet again.</p>
                <h2>Brock Harrison</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Pokemon/brock.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><B>Brock Harrison</B> is the <b>deuteragonist</b> of the Pokemon the Series first thirteen seasons. He is the one of Ash's first traveling companions and the former leader of the <B>Pewter Gym.</B></p>
                <p>Brock originally trained <b>Rock-type Pokémon</b>. As he has stated his philosophy is that the important thing about being a Pokémon Trainer is the <b>bond</b> between <b>Trainer and Pokémon.</b> He is an experienced cook and caretaker by nature, so he always makes scrumptious food both for Pokémon and for humans.</p>
                <p>One of his best known character traits is that he falls in love with every pretty woman he meets, particularly <b> Officer Jenny and Nurse Joy</b>, but was constantly put a stop by <b>Misty or Max</b> with an <b>ear pull</b>, or <b>Croagunk</b> with <b>Poison Jab</b>. He can tell whether they are real women or impostors as well. This "ability" has been used multiple times in the series. He has always held a supporting role in the series, usually contributing more in terms of wisdom and comedic antics than the action and battles of the series. Usually, Brock is obsessed with the girls in each episode of Pokémon franchise.</p>
                <h2>Goh</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Pokemon/goh.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Goh</b> is a Pokémon Trainer who is formerly <b>Ash Ketchum's</b> travelling companion and serves as the <b>deuteragonist</b> of <b>Pokémon Journeys: The Series</b>. His goal is to catch every Pokémon in every region, in the hopes of accomplishing his dream of catching <b>Mew</b>.</p>
                <p>Although he usually has a calm demeanor, he can also get hot-blooded. Goh also has an ego and sometimes behaves like a know-it-all. However, Goh really cares about Pokémon and gets excited about meeting them, much like Ash does.</p>
                <p> Currently, Goh is known to own 108 Pokémon, with 115 or 116 unique Pokémon species registered in his Pokédex. Goh has learned to put his Pokémon happiness and needs first before himself, and would help them solve or work out their problems. In addition, Goh has improved his battling skills, even using some of Ash's tactics for battling.</p>
