                <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
                <img src="../assets/Jujutsu Kaisen/jjk poster.jpg" alt="jujutsu-kaisen" id="poster" draggable="false">
                <p><b>Jujutsu Kaisen</b> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by <b>Gege Akutami</b>. It has been serialized in <b>Shueisha's shōnen</b> manga magazine <b>Weekly Shōnen Jump</b> since March 2018, with its chapters collected and published in <b>22 tankōbon volumes</b> as of March 2023.</p>
                <p>The story follows high school student <b>Yuji Itadori</b> as he joins a secret organization of <b>Jujutsu Sorcerers</b> to eliminate a powerful Curse named <b>Ryomen Sukuna</b>, of whom Yuji becomes the host. Jujutsu Kaisen is a sequel to Akutami's <b>Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School</b>, serialized in Shueisha's Jump GIGA from April to July 2017, later collected in a tankōbon volume, retroactively titled as <b>Jujutsu Kaisen 0</b>, in December 2018.</p>
                <p>In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called <b>Cursed Energy</b>, which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of <b>Curses</b>, a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome <b>monsters, ghosts<span id="authh"></span></b>.</p>

                <h1>CHARACTERS</h1>
                <h2>Itadori Yuji</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Jujutsu Kaisen/yuji.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Yuji Itadori</b> is the main protagonist of the popular 2018 dark fantasy anime and manga series <b>Jujutsu Kaisen.</b>Yuji is an easygoing high school student with a kind disposition. After the death of his grandfather, he vows to help others so that he may die "surrounded by loved ones", and makes it a point to ensure the people around him attain what he considers a "proper death". Through a chance encounter with <b>Megumi Fushiguro</b> and a dangerous cursed spirit, he ingests one of the fingers of <b>Sukuna, the King of Curses</b>, and becomes his vessel.</p>
                <p>Even without supernatural powers, as an ordinary human, Yuji is significantly strong with superhuman strength, with shown feats such as throwing a car. His cursed energy has a delay due to not being able to keep up with his speed; this means his hits hit twice: one from the initial physical impact and the second impact of cursed energy. This is known as his <b>"Divergent Fist"</b>; it is not a proper Cursed Technique however, since anyone else can theoretically learn it. It's said that he'll eventually learn Sukuna's Cursed Technique. He can also use <b>Black Flash</b>, a technique that creates <b>spatial distortion</b> when a user connects with an impact of cursed energy within 0.000001 seconds of a physical hit.</p>
                <h2>Satoru Gojo</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Jujutsu Kaisen/gojo.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Satoru Gojo</b> is one of the main protagonists of the <b>Jujutsu Kaisen series</b>. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the <b>Gojo Family</b>, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the <b>Tokyo Jujutsu High</b> and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.</p>
                <p>Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards his Principal, and his enemies.</p>
                <p>Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength, and he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant. He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world.</p>
                <h2>Ryomen Sukuna</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Jujutsu Kaisen/sukuna.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Ryomen Sukuna</b>, more often called just Sukuna, is a mighty cursed spirit known as the <b>Disgraced One</b> and the <b>Undisputed King of Curses</b>. He serves as one of the primary antagonists of the <b>Jujutsu Kaisen series</b>.</p>
                <p>Sukuna is selfish, cold-hearted, immoral, and exceptionally sadistic. When he was reincarnated shortly after <b>Yuji</b> ingested his finger, he commented, implying the slaughter of women and children and likening them to maggots crawling around. Due to his immense power, he rarely cares about the consequences of his actions, even if these affect his host, Yuji Itadori. In fact, he frequently taunts and insults Yuji, calling him a brat and even laughing at or enjoying Yuji's despair on multiple occasions.</p>
                <p>However, these brutish traits are not to be confused for stupidity. Sukuna is highly intelligent and manipulative, taking Yuji's body hostage by tearing out his heart to force him into a Binding Vow. He has also displayed the ability to acknowledge and praise his opponents.</p>
                <h2>Megumi Fushiguro</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Jujutsu Kaisen/megumi.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Megumi Fushiguro</b> is the deuteragonist of the <b>Jujutsu Kaisen</b> series. He is a grade 2 jujutsu sorcerer and first-year student at <b>Tokyo Jujutsu High</b> alongside <b>Yuji Itadori</b> and <b>Nobara Kugisaki</b>. Megumi was born outside the clan as Toji's trump card and was eventually found by <b>Satoru Gojo</b>, who mentored him and enrolled him at Jujutsu High as his student.</p>
                <p>Megumi is a very outwardly stoic, aloof, and calculating individual. He usually has a neutral facial expression that he rarely changes and appears to take every situation seriously. This contrasts with Yuji, Nobara, and Satoru's outgoing and goofy personalities, which often annoy Megumi. He's easily irritated and Yuji has noted that Megumi seems like he's always slightly angry.</p>
                <p> Megumi possesses one of the highest potentials of any student at Jujutsu High regardless of age.  He inherited the prized <b>Ten Shadows Technique</b> of the Zenin clan and is favored by the strongest sorcerer himself. Satoru believes that Megumi could become as strong as he is and has stated he likely possesses even more skill and potential than Yuji.</p>
                <h2>Nobara Kugisaki</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Jujutsu Kaisen/nobara.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Nobara Kugisaki</b> is the tritagonist of the <b>Jujutsu Kaisen</b> series. She is a first-year student and grade 3 jujutsu sorcerer at <b>Tokyo Jujutsu High</b> studying under <b>Satoru Gojo</b> alongside <b>Yuji</b> and <b>Megumi</b>.</p>
                <p>Nobara is a confident and brash young woman with an unshakable character. More than anything, Nobara is determined to stay true to herself no matter what. She takes great pride in being both a pretty girl and a strong fighter, refusing to let anyone influence her.</p>
                <p>Nobara has high reserves of cursed energy and is an expert on manipulating it. Nobara's nails are constantly being imbued with her cursed energy, allowing her to levitate them for easy hammering. She can even use cursed techniques to expand the cursed energy that surrounds them. She has done so repeatedly on several occasions without showing any signs of exhausting her cursed energy supply</p>
