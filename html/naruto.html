                <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
                <img src="../assets/Naruto/naruto poster.jpg" alt="naruto" id="poster" draggable="false">
                <p><b>Naruto</b> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by <b>Masashi Kishimoto</b>. It tells the story of <b>Naruto Uzumaki</b>, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the <b>Hokage, the leader of his village</b>. The story is told in <b>two parts</b> — the first set in Naruto's <b>pre-teen </b> years, and the second in his <b>teens</b>. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: <b>Karakuri (1995)</b>, which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in <b>Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award</b> the following year, and <b>Naruto (1997)</b>.</p>
                <p>A powerful fox known as the <b>Nine-Tails</b> attacks <b>Konoha, the hidden leaf village</b> in the <b>Land of Fire</b>, one of the <b>Five Great Shinobi Countries</b> in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, <b>Minato Namikaze</b> seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, <b>Naruto Uzumaki</b>, making Naruto a host of the beast; this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats the ninja in combat, earning the respect of his teache.</p>
                <p>Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with <b>Sasuke Uchiha</b> and <b>Sakura Haruno</b>, on whom he has a crush, to form <b>Team 7</b>, under an experienced sensei, <b>the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake</b>. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations. The story revolves around Naruto's journey to become the Hokage and the hardships he faces to achieve it. <span id="authh"></span></p>

                <h2>Naruto Uzumaki</h2>

He is a shinobi of <b>Konohagakure</b>, who lived his early childhood as an outcast when he was turned into the <b>jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails</b> at birth. Nonetheless, he worked his way through many obstacles and achievements in hopes of achieving his dream of becoming <b>Hokage</b>. Having done so much for many, he was recognized across the world as a <b>Hero</b> and was eventually able to become the <b>Seventh Hokage of Konohagakure</b>.</p>
                <p>Naruto is a boisterous and exuberant boy. He would end sentences with <b>"Dattebayo!"</b> when excited or frustrated. He has a number of childish traits, such as being a very picky, being afraid of ghosts, and carries a chubby green-frog wallet which he calls <b>"Gama-chan"</b>. Naruto has a personality that brings people to him, inspiring friendship, loyalty and love from most of the people he meets through acts of genuine kindness and sincerity that could change a person's entire world view.</p>
                <p>In the later part of his life he is married to his Love <b>Hinata Hyuga</b> and had 2 children <b>Boruto Uzumaki</b> and <b>Himawari Uzumaki</b>.</p>
                <h2>Sasuke Uchiha</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Naruto/sasuke.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Sasuke Uchiha</b> is the <b>deuteragonist</b> of the <b>Naruto franchise</b>. When he was a child, Sasuke was very kind, loving towards his parents and older brother and respectful to his fellow clansmen as well as his teachers. After <b>Itachi</b> massacred the clan, Sasuke's ideals and personality changed drastically due to him suffering his clan's curse and became cold, indifferent, cruel, cynical, callous, somewhat arrogant, unreasonable and devoted the next nine years of his life to kill Itachi.</p>
                <p>When he is first introduced to <b>Team Kakashi</b>, Sasuke displayed great indifference to his team-mates as well as others. Feeling superior to all of them, including his teacher, Sasuke was unwilling to cooperate with any of his team-mates, as he felt they would provide him no aid in furthering his ambition to kill his brother. However over time, as he interacted more with his team mates on a day-to-day basis, he began to see them as somewhat of a family and Sasuke started to lose some of his hatred, caring more about his team than his revenge.</p>
                <p>In the later part of his life he is married to <b>Sakura Haruno</b> who had a crush on him ever since she met him and had a daughter named <b>Sarada Uchiha</b>.</p>
                <h2>Sakura Haruno</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Naruto/sakura.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Sakura Haruno</b> is the <b>tritagonist</b> of the <b>Naruto franchise</b>. Sakura was noted for being an honor student for her scholastic intelligence in the Academy, she became narcissistic as she was more interested in her appearance and Sasuke as opposed to practicing her ninja skills.</p>
                <p>Over time, Sakura became more mature as she developed a mutual friendship with her teammates. As her core, Sakura is compassionate, determined and courageous, willing to sacrifice herself and combat those she knows to be superior to her to defend her team. She has shown that despite being overcritical, overbearing, hot-tempered and blunt at times, especially with Naruto, she can be supportive of her friends.</p>
                <p>In her later life she was married to her long time love <b>Sasuke Uchiha</b> and gave birth to her daughter <b>Sarada Uchiha</b>.</p>
                <h2>Kakashi Hatake</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Naruto/kakashi.webp" alt="" id="chpos">

Such Jutsus that he has are <b>Lightning Blade, Kamui, Fire Style Jutsu</b> which he gains due to his Sharingan and many others. He is the biggest fan of <b>Jiraiya's "Icha Icha"</b> novel.</p>
                <p>Since his childhood, Kakashi was very independent and self-confident, at times even appearing arrogant and condescending. Despite that, Kakashi was very perceptive and intuitive, quickly realizing the situation for what it was. After his father's death, Kakashi became more stern, aloof and cold toward others, following all the rules to the letter, chastising any who disobeyed them and being willing to abandon his comrades to finish missions. However, he came to regret this attitude after <b>Obito</b> lectured him on how comradery was more important than any mission and Obito's apparent death came to make Kakashi name his <b>Chidori</b> as a technique capable of protecting friends.</p>
                <h2>Hinata Hyuga</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Naruto/hinata.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Hinata Hyuga</b> is <b>major protagonist</b> in the <b>Naruto anime/manga series</b>. She is a <b>chūnin-level kunoichi</b> of <b>Konohagakure's Hyūga clan</b> and a member of <b>Team Kurenai</b>. She is also the love interest <b>Naruto Uzumaki</b> and a few years after the war, she married him and together they had two children <b>Boruto Uzumaki</b> and <b>Himawari Uzumaki</b>.</p>
                <p>Hinata is characterized as a shy, thoughtful, serene, kind and very polite girl, as noted from her always addressing people with proper honourifics. Back in her childhood, as a result of her clan's high expectations as their heiress and her father's grueling training and him deeming her as a failure, Hinata had become very timid and lacked self-confidence. However, she has shown to be a very hard worker, as she continuously strived to change herself for the better, though initially this lack of self-confidence would hinder her on even missions.</p>
                <p>Hinata is the girl that every man wants to marry, also a  lot of Fans do have a <b>Massive Crush</b> on Hinata.</p>
                <h2>Jiraiya</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Naruto/jiraiya.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Jiraiya</b>, also known as <b>Perverted Hermit or Pervy Sage</b>, is one of the supporting characters in the <b>Naruto universe</b>.

                <p>Jiraiya terms himself as <b>"Jiraiya The Gallant" or "The Toad Sage"</b> which suits him well. He travels around the world writing Books. Even the Legendary <b>Itachi Uchiha</b> is frightened by him as Jiraiya gave him a Death Stare straight to Itachi's eyes which no one else dares to do. This truly explains the Mightiness of <b>Jiraiya The Gallant.</b></p>
                <h2>Itachi Uchiha</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Naruto/itachi.png" alt="" id="chpos">   
                <p><b>Itachi Uchiha</b> is one of the supporting characters and an <b>anti-villain</b> in the <b>Naruto franchise</b>. He is an <b>ANBU Captain</b> and a prodigy from <b>Konohagakure's famed Uchiha clan</b>. Since his childhood, Itachi was quiet and insightful. He lived at a distance, observing individuals and ideas without getting directly involved so he can fully understand them. Although this prevented him from becoming close to many people, it enabled him to think and act without prejudice or preconceptions, instead evaluating things strictly on their own merits.</p>
                <p>Itachi devoted his life entirely to Konohagakure's welfare. When the <b>Uchiha Clan</b> planned to ambush the village Itachi massacred his own clan for the village as per the orders of the Third Hokage. By this he was termed a <b>"Traitor"</b> by the entire village while in actual he was the <b>"Unsung Hero"</b> who saved them all.</p>
                <p>Itachi specialized in <b>genjutsu</b>, where the illusions would typically involve <b>crows</b>. Regarded as one of Konohagakure's best users, even without the aid of his Sharingan, his illusions have remarkable potency, able to seamlessly affect his targets without them realizing it, while on guard, and also perform them by merely pointing at his target. He can defeat any man on the planet with just a look of his eyes.</p>
