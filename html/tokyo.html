                <h1>CHARACTERS</h1>
                <h2>Takemichi Hanagaki</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Tokyo/takemichi.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Takemichi Hanagaki</b> is the <b>main protagonist</b> of the 2017 Japanese manga series <b>Tokyo Revengers</b> and its 2021 anime adaptation. He is a young man who can travel back in time: <b>a time leaper</b>. In order to save his girlfriend <b>Hinata Tachibana</b> and over time, everyone he comes to care about, he decides to become a top member of the <b>Tokyo Manji Gang</b> in order to do so.</p>
                <p>Takemichi has a strong determination even if that brings harm to himself. For instance, he had to go through so many tough situations whilst being a part of the Toman Gang. He is an individual who’s lost the sense of direction, and that’s why he’s got low self-esteem. He apologizes for the smallest things and cries easily. He’s called a <b>“crybaby hero”</b> by his best friend <b>Akkun</b>.</p>
                <p>As he’s not very financially stable, he badmouths the rich people. He’s the best version of a weak crybaby who’s empathetic and kind beyond his years and never gives up.                </p>
                <h2>Hinata Tachibana</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Tokyo/hinata.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Hinata Tachibana</b> is <b>Takemichi Hanagaki's girlfriend</b>. She is the primary reason for Takemichi's desire to change the past.</p>
                <p>Hinata has a very outgoing and upbeat personality who is highly optimistic and always finds ways to make undesirable situations better. Even when others become demoralized or despair, Hinata remains strong in order to push them forward. </p>
                <p>She is an incredibly strong-willed and determined teenager, willing to take drastic measures in order to protect those she cares about. At the same time, this can make her reckless and not consider certain courses of action carefully, as she slapped <b>Mikey</b> when they first met while trying to defend <b>Takemichi</b> although she had misunderstood the situation completely, which, fortunately, ended without major repercussions although with a scolding of what her actions could have triggered.</p>
                <h2>Manjiro Sano (Mikey)</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Tokyo/mikey.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Manjiro Sano</b> or <b>Mikey</b>, is a founding member and the former leader of the <b>Tokyo Manji Gang</b>. In a past timeline, Mikey was the leader of the <b>Kanto Manji Gang</b>. He is the <b>deuteragonist</b> of the <b>Tokyo Revengers</b> manga series and its anime adaptation.</p>
                <p>Mikey is usually a carefree teenager who loves to joke and play pranks around those he considers his close friends. He cares for them greatly and is determined to protect their honor. He rarely shows any sign of weakness, as he believes himself to be the foundation and support for <b>Toman (Tokyo Manji)</b>, and if the pillar himself were to display weakness, Toman would also be weakened.</p>
                <p>Even in instances where Mikey succumbs to that darkness, there are conflicting aspects of his personality and contradicting behavior. </p>
                <h2>Ken Ryuguji</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Tokyo/draken.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Ken Ryuguji</b> or <b>Draken</b>, is a founding member and the former Vice-Leader of the <b>Tokyo Manji Gang</b>. In a past timeline, he became a member of the <b>motorbike gang Brahman</b>.</p>
                <p>Like the president, vice-president Draken is also quite the wild individual. He loves a good fight and relishes meeting strong opponents. He is rude to those he considers beneath him and makes it clear he does not like them.</p>
                <p>Unlike <b>Mikey</b>, Draken is the more mature and logical of the two. When the two are being scolded in the hospital by the father of a girl who was assaulted by a member of <b>Toman</b>, Draken is the one who forces Mikey down to apologize, understanding the man's rage and that it was better to receive his anger without a word than to try and defend themselves.</p>
                <p>Draken is also a very caring individual. He hates overtly showing affection to the ones he cares about but will go to great lengths to take care of Mikey. He puts up with Mikey's antics and values him as a close friend, carries Mikey around when he falls asleep, takes him to eat his favorite foods, and wakes him up every morning for school.</p>
                <h2>Tetta kisaki</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Tokyo/kisaki.png" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Tetta Kisaki</b> is the main <b>antagonist</b> of <b>Tokyo Revengers</b> up until his death after the <b>Kanto Incident</b>. He rose to the top of the Tokyo Manji Gang by manipulating <b>Manjiro Sano</b> and orchestrated <b>Hinata Tachibana's murder</b> in several different futures.</p>
                <p>Kisaki is a ruthless, cunning, and ambitious individual who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Although average in stature, his power to rule with fear makes even those stronger than him obey him. The entirety of his actions in the entire story revolves around becoming the most powerful and influential criminal in <b>Tokyo</b>.</p>
                <p>Kisaki's number one drive in life is his obsessive love for <b>Hinata</b> developed during his childhood. Seeing how Hinata was attracted to <b>Takemichi</b> who wanted to become a <b>delinquent</b>, he researched and came to the natural conclusion that if he became <b>Japan's top delinquent</b> then Hinata would come to love him as a proxy of his superiority.</p>
