                <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
                <img src="../assets/Spy X Family/spyposter.jpg" alt="spy-x-family" id="poster" draggable="false">
                <p><b>Spy × Family</b> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by <b>Tatsuya Endo</b>. The story follows a spy who has to "build a family" to execute a mission, not realizing that the girl he adopts as his daughter is a telepath, and the woman he agrees to be in a marriage <span id="rgn1"></span> with is a skilled assassin. The series has been serialized biweekly on <b>Shueisha's Shōnen Jump+</b> application and website since March 2019, with the chapters collected in eleven tankōbon volumes as of April 2023. It was licensed in North America by <b>Viz Media</b>.</p>
                <p>In order to maintain the state of peace between the rival nations of <b>Westalis</b> and <b>Ostania</b>, a Westalian agent code-named <b>"Twilight"</b> is tasked with spying on <b>Donovan Desmond</b>, leader of the <b>National Unity Party</b> within Ostania. However, due to Desmond being notoriously reclusive, the only way Twilight can get close to him is to enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's sons and pose as a fellow parent.</p>
                <p>To accomplish this and present the image of a happy family, he creates the alias of <b>Loid Forger</b>, adopts a young orphan girl named <b>Anya</b>, and marries a woman named <b>Yor Briar</b>. However, unbeknownst to him Anya can read minds and Yor is in fact a professional assassin. Neither Loid nor Yor are aware of each other's true identities, or that Anya knows their true professions. The family later takes in a dog with precognitive abilities whom they name <b>Bond</b>. Despite these unknown factors and Twilight's occasional lapses of common sense due to years of being a spy, he must learn to play the role of the perfect father and husband in order to carry out his mission.<span id="authh"></span></p>

                <h1>CHARACTERS</h1>
                <h2>Loid Forger</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Spy X Family/Loid Forger.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Loid Forger</b> is the main protagonist of the <b>SPY x FAMILY</b> series. He has discarded everything about his past to work for his country as an undercover spy who acts under the codename <b>"Twilight"</b>. His real name is unknown, and he created the name "Loid Forger" as an alias.For his current mission, he is required to marry and have a child.Thus, he enters a marriage with <b>Yor Briar</b> and becomes the adoptive father of <b>Anya Forger.</b></p>
                <p>Loid is a handsome man with short blond hair, blue eyes, and light skin. His hair is often slicked back to varying degrees, depending on the occasion. He is quite tall, with a slim but athletic build. His exact age is unknown, although his history and appearance point to him being in his late twenties or early thirties. Because of his handsome looks, many girls become infatuated with him. </p>
                <p>Befitting of a spy, his true personality is rather cold and methodical, doing whatever it takes to complete the mission, from joining terrorist organizations to dating a target's daughter to becoming a father. However, he has a kind personality that reveals itself when he defends his family, even at the risk of his mission.Loid's title as Westalis's greatest spy is quite deserved. His skills, both physical and mental, are second to none.</p>
                <h2>Yor Forger(Yor Briar)</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Spy X Family/Yor briar.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Yor Forger</b> is the tritagonist of the series <b>Spy × Family</b>. She is a 27-year-old assassin who is pretending to be married to <b>Loid Forger</b> and pretending to be the mother of <b>Anya Forger</b>. As an assassin working for the Garden, she is known by her code-name, the <b>"Thorn Princess".</b></p>
                <p>Yor Forger is a beautiful young woman with light skin, black hair, and reddish eyes. Her hair has a headband and is split into two-part ways which crosses over her head. She has a pair of dangling earrings. She usually wears a red sweater that exposes her shoulders and back along with a red skirt. Her lower body outfit consists of black leggings and a pair of brown ankle boots.</p>
                <p>Yor is rather shy and introverted, coming across as a somewhat aloof individual, interacting minimally with her coworkers and being described by Camilla as a robot. Similarly, Yor is remarkably collected, able to keep her composure in the midst of combat. She is incredibly polite to the point of asking her assassination targets if she may take their lives. After becoming a family with Loid and Anya, Yor becomes more expressive and opens up to her coworkers, asking for help on being a better wife or cooking. She is protective of her faux family, especially towards Anya whom she has no trouble defending with extreme violence</p>
                <h2>Anya Forger</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Spy X Family/Anya Forger.webp" alt="" id="chpos">
                <p><b>Anya Forger</b> is the deuteragonist in the series <b>Spy × Family</b>. She is the adoptive daughter of <b>Loid Forger</b> and <b>Yor Forger</b>, having been taken under Loid's care as part of his current mission. In her past life, she is an orphan known as <b>Test Subject 007</b>, where an accidental creation gave her telepathic abilities.</p>
                <p>Anya is a bubbly and cheerful young girl. She appears to be much smarter than she actually is, and while this is probably true to an extent, this is likely artificially inflated because she can read other people's minds, a fact that nobody aside from her is aware of.</p>
                <p>Being an orphan who's hopped between several families before becoming a Forger, she became quickly attached to Loid and Yor as her father and mother respectively. She's also eager to make friends in general, seeing as she had none while at the orphanage. However, despite her apparent maturity, there are aspects of her that reminds you of her age, such as how quickly she became violent when someone teases her emotions</p>
